# Ticketing Project #

We are creating a ticketing platform that takes care of everything from end to end. It allows venues to create seat maps and issue tickets for it, allows users to buy and resell those tickets, and allows concessions to be packaged with tickets as well. The system is meant to be used in anything from a small fundraising gala to selling tickets for Taylor Swiftâ€™s Eras tour.
